## Import and clean the data

For each of the following, click on the 'get data' option to start the process. Then, choose the appropriate option depending on the data source:
- Import the Orders table by connecting to the Azure SQL database using the database credentials option. If you are having issues connecting to this database ensure you don't select the orders_db section, and you don't need to include this in the optional database entry.
- Import the Products table using the csv option, finding the file in your downloads unless you've stored this elsewhere.
- Import the Stores table by connecting to the Azure Blob storage option. This data might not load as you'd expect, with a table appearing and only one row of information. Use the 'drill down' button on the 'name' column to load the data. This column should have the Products.csv text in the cell below the column heading.
- Import the Customers table by selecting get data, folder. This will load the files in your folder and combine them into a single table if you select 'combine and transform'. Ensure the zip file is unzipped.

Ensure the data is clean by eliminating rows with null values (you can do this by filtering the null values out and the save & load the query), ensure all columns are named consistently (I have opted for a 'Customer Info' style), ensure all columns have the correct data type (you can click on the data type for each column heading), delete any unused columns and split columns if you think this would benefit your analysis.

----------------------------------------

## Creating the data model

### *Date Table*
- To create a date table, I used the following DAX expression when creating a new table in Power Query Editor:
  
    Date = \
    ADDCOLUMNS (\
        CALENDAR (\
            MIN(Orders[Order Date]),\
            MAX(Orders[Shipping Date])\
        ),\
        "Year", YEAR([Date]),\
        "Month", MONTH([Date]),\
        "Day", DAY([Date])\
    )
    
*You need to right click on the date table and select 'Mark as date table'*

- I then used formulae like the following, to create StartofMonth/Quarter/Year columns by clicking on "New Column" whilst selecting my date table on the data tab (to ensure your new columns land in your date table):

StartofMonth = MONTH('Date'[Date])

- I also looked at using the SWITCH function to ensure I could have worded Months etc:

StartofMonthName = SWITCH('Date'[StartofMonth], 1, "Jan", 2, "Feb", 3, "Mar", 4, "Apr", 5, "May", 6, "Jun", 7, "Jul", 8, "Aug", 9, "Sep", 10, "Oct", 11, "Nov", 12, "Dec")

- And finally I created a Date Hierarcy to allow me to drill down into data by date types - This is as simple as right clicking on your first date type and selecting 'Create Hierarchy'. Then, in order, right click on the next date type and click 'Add to hierarchy', selecting your Date Hierarchy.

### *Building the model*
On the left of the screen you can see three views - Report, Table and Model. Click on 'Model View' and ensure your tables have the appropriate relationships. Ensure the relationships are one-to-many, if possible, and ensure the filter direction is one-way (single) from the one to many column. If there's more than one relationship between two tables, make the correct decision on which relationship is active.

### *Create a Measure Table*
The best approach to creating a measure table is by doing so in Model View with Power Query Editor so that the table appears in the Query Editor.
To do this, click 'New Table' when in Power Query Editor and name the table 'Measures Table'.
After adding a new measure to the table you can delete the existing column that was automatically added when creating the table.
Now, ensure you have clicked on the measure table before you create any new measures - which ensures your new measure is stored in your measures table.

### *Create key measures*
I created key measures to prepare for analysis, using DAX expressions:\
- TotalOrders = COUNT(Orders[Product Code])
- TotalProfit = SUMX(Orders, (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price])) * Orders[Product Quantity])
- TotalQuantity = SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])
- TotalCustomers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[User ID])
- Total Revenue = SUMX(Orders, Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price]))
- RevenueYTD = CALCULATE(\
    [Total Revenue],\
    DATESYTD('Date'[Date])\
    )
- ProfitYTD = CALCULATE(\
    [TotalProfit],\
    DATESYTD('Date'[Date])\
  )

### *Create a Geography Hierarcy*
As before with the Date Hierarchy, we can do the same with Geography.
Ensure the data categories are correct for this, so I made sure the 'Region' data category was changed to 'Continent', for example.

----------------------------------------

## Customer Detail Page
I created the following visuals, whilst ensuring I followed a consistent format using the format tab for each visual:
- Headline Card Visuals\
Use the 'card' visual with total customers and a new measure, Revenue per Customer.
- Summary Chart\
Use the 'donut' visual with Unique Customers in the Values section and Country in the details section.
- Line Chart\
Date Hierarchy as an x value and Unique Customers as a y value.\
Click on 'add further analysis to your visual' in the visualisation pane to include a Trend Line and Forecast.
- Top 20 Customers Table\
Include whichever information you want in the customer table, applying a Top20 filter.
- Top Customer Cards\
See below.
- Date Slicer

These were fairly easy to produce, with time mainly taken to ensure they were formatted in a presentable way. However, the 'Top Customer Cards' were initially tricky as I couldn't produce a TopN filter, as I used the 'Card' visual. To get around this, I created 3 tables and then applied the TopN filter by adding the 'Full Name' column to each visual filter.

*My finished customer detail page*

----------------------------------------

## Executive Summary Page

I duplicated many of the visuals from the Customer Details page to create the following visuals for the Executive Page:

- Total Revenue, Total Orders and Total Profit card visuals
- A line chart with Total Profit
- Donut charts for Revenue
- A bar chart of Total Orders by Category
- KPI Visuals

To create KPI Visuals I needed to create Previous Quarter measures. For example, for Previous Quarter Profit I used:\
Previous Quarter Profit = CALCULATE([TotalProfit], PREVIOUSQUARTER('Date'[Date]))

*Screenshot of my executive summary*

----------------------------------------

## Product Detail Page

Using a combination of my previous pages and new visuals, I created the following to show product details:

- 3 gauge visuals that tracks Revenue, Profit and Orders, creating new measures that looked at QTD and targets using DAX measures like:\
Current Quarter Orders = CALCULATE([Total Orders], DATESQTD('Date'[Date]))\
Quarterly Target Orders = 1.1 * [Current Quarter Order]
- An area chart with the x-axis using my Date Hierarchy, the y-axis using Total Revenue and the legend using Product Category
-  A Top Products table with relevant information and using a previous table made this a very quick exercise
-  A scatter graph of Quantity Sold vs Profit per Item
-  A slicer toolber\
This was tricky in the sense that I needed to make sure the bookmarks, buttons and selections were in the correct order. First, I created the infrastructure by inserting rectangles and two vertical slicers (country and product category). Then, I ordered these at the top of the selection panel, whilst grouping them through this. I created two buttons that allows the user to open and close the slicer bar, so needed to create two bookmarks - one with the slicer bar open, and one with it hidden in the selection panel. Finally, I enabled actions in both of my buttons, assigning the filter button the 'slicer bar open' bookmark, and the back button the 'slicer bar closed' bookmark.

----------------------------------------

## Stores Map Page

I added a Stores Map page, which lead to me creating a drillthrough and toolkit page to help navigation through the map visual:

- Adding a map visual
- Add a country tile slicer to the top of the page
- Create a drillthrough page with the visuals that I need - the important note here is to add the Country column to the drillthrough option on the drillthrough page which allows you to right-click on the map visual to drillthrough
- Create a tooltip page with a Profit YTD gauge\
You need to ensure this tooltip option is enabled and scaled correctly.\
To enable, go to File - Options and Settings - Options - Preview Features - Check 'Modern Visual Tooltips' and restart Power BI.\
To ensure the Tooltip is scaled, go to File - Options and Settings - Options - Report Settings - Tooltips Auto-Scale.

----------------------------------------

## Cross-Filtering and Navigation

Fix the cross filtering: Use the 'Edit Interactions' option from Format to allow some visuals to not be affected by the filtering of others. Simply click on a visual and a 'stop' sign appears on other visuals to allow you to switch off the cross-filtering function.

Navigation: Click on Insert - Buttons - Blank to insert a blank button to allow you to edit the visual using the format visual options in the visualisation pane. Under 'Style' you can add an icon and a fill, which changes the colour of the navigation button if you hover over it (state: on hover). To ensure the button actions as a navigation button click on the action dropdown and change type to page navigation, using the destination dropdown to choose the relevant page.

*Screenshot of the completed navigation tab with alternate icons depending on hover*

----------------------------------------

## SQL Queries

I finished this project by creating metrics for users outside the company using SQL. To do this, I:

- Connected to the SQL Server through VSCode\
Connection Name: OrdersDB\
Connect using: Server and Port\
Server address: powerbi-data-analytics-server.postgres.database.azure.com\
Port: 5432\
Database: orders-db\
Username: ****\
Password: Ask on connect\
I done this using the SQLTools extension which you can get in the extensions tab, and I used the PostgreSQL connection.

- I printed the list of tables and columns within the tables, to help me with my queries, shown in the following screenshot:

*Screenshot of the SQL code used to get table and column lists*

- I queried the database to answer the following 5 questions, with all queries (.sql) and results (.csv) uploaded to this repo:\
Q1. How many staff are there in UK stores?\
Q2. In 2022, which month had the highest revenue?\
Q3. In 2022, which German store had the highest revenue?\
Q4. Create a table that has store types, total sales, percentage of total sales and order count.\
Q5. Which product category generated the most profit for "Wiltshire, UK", in 2021?
